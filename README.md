# S3VS

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of S3VS is to perform variable selection using the structured screen-and-select (S3VS) framework in linear models, generalized linear models with binary data, and survival models such as the Cox model and accelerated failure time (AFT) model.

## Installation

You can install the development version of S3VS like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("nilotpalsanyal/S3VS")
```

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->
